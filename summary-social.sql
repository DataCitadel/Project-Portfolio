-- 2. Is LetsMeet membership leveling off?
-The number of new members that joined increased significantly every year since the first year that letsmeet was created.
-It appears that new members that join hit a plateau in the year 2017, but there is more to this story. 
-2017 was on course for a significant increase in the number of new members over the year 2016, but for 2017's November and December there was an anomaly
in the data where 230 people joined for november and only 13 for december. This makes it appear that since 2016, the growth for 2017 reached stagnation.
Otherwise, aside from these two months I can not say that membership growth was an issue. 
-There are three reasons that I can think of for this being the case:
   - Since 2017 is the latest data available, it could be possible that some of the data has not been added into the table yet.
   - It could be an unusually busy season for holiday travel outside of the city or a time where other subjects took priority in life.
   - There is an outside influence or societal condition that reduced the populations desire to socialize, at least through letsmeet.
- Any of these possibilities are worth looking into to to get more background on them and to find an accurate idea as to what happened.
- Overall there does not seem much cause for concern just yet given the recency of the data in what is currently available.

-- 3. What five groups should marketing feature in their upcoming campaign?*
The five groups that I would recommend are as follows below. 
	-NYC Art Meetup: Has 9082 members, and category is Arts & Culture
    -NYC Local Singles and Professionals Get Togethers: Has 5776 members, and category is Food & Drink
    -New York Travel Photography: Has 4786 members,and category is Photography
    -Sketch & Design - San Francisco: Has 2255 members, and category is Tech
    -Chicago Young Professionals - Business, Social & Tech Events: Has 4057 members, and category is Socializing
I recommend these groups because they all have full five star ratings and they are also the groups with the most members in desecending order
grouped by their locality as requested. There are the top three most popular for New York, the most popular for San Francisco, and then the most popular
for Chicago. There is also a wide variety of categories in this group as none of them repeat amongst the five groups that are shown. This helps 
the groups listed above to meet the goal of both popularity and diversity.
